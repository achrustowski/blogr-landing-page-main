## Overview

Flex your layout muscles with this landing page challenge. You'll mostly be working with HTML & CSS for this project with a tiny bit of JS for the mobile menu.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

Custom variables for styling and setting the backgrounds for desktop view. Mix of Flex and Grid. A little bit of issues with mobile-nav (I failed to plan correctly my HTML in that area).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the hard way what happens when you incorrectly set containers for your nav... Had a real struggle fixing mobile-nav and ended up having to create new code especially for the mobile view.

I also learned to put more effort in using custom variables for padding as I ended up having to go back and forth creating multiple media queries that essentially had just padding in them.

I also learned to organise media queries in a more readable way and to avoid re-writing media queries.

### Continued development

Flex, Grid, media queries, custom variables.
